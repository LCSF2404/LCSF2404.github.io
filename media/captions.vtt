00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:03,370
This is a beginners guide to grilling on a
charcoal grill.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,609
I'm going to help you get started on the right
foot and avoid some of those common mistakes.

3
00:00:07,609 --> 00:00:11,559
Let's dig in to the anatomy of the most common
charcoal grill, the Weber kettle.

4
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:14,940
This is the food grate and below it is the
charcoal grate, and that is where you put

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,420
your hot coals.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,410
Beneath that is the ash cleanout system that
is controlled by this handle on the bottom.

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,470
It also acts as a damper to regulate air flow
and the temperature.

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,510
It is a good idea to mark where 1/4 open,
1/2 open, and full open are on the bottom

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,800
so you don't have to guess by looking through
the holes when you are cooking.

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,970
The lid has a vent that serves the exact same
purpose.

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,340
I'll deep dive on how the vents works in just
a little bit.

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,800
If you are looking at a new kettle spring
for the one with the ash catcher.

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,040
Its convenient and avoids a big mess and is
well worth the upgrade.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,940
A lot of people will oversell you on the BBQ
accessories that you need, but this is the

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,060
basic starter pack.

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,960
A charcoal chimney makes it really easy to
light charcoal and avoids using lighter fluid,

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,531
which can put an off taste on your meat.

18
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:55,960
You are going to need some tongs as well as
a spatula to move the food around.

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,770
You'll need a good grill grate cleaning device
like a wire brush that makes cleaning those

20
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,059
grill grates a snap.

21
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:04,599
A good instant read thermometer is really
helpful because it will keep you from under

22
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:08,100
cooking the food and making people sick or
over cooking it and making it dry.

23
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,170
Beyond that, it is mostly just extras that
are nice to have.

24
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,319
One of my favorites is a wireless thermometer.

25
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:16,460
That allows me to check the temperature of
the pit and the meat while I'm inside and

26
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,950
it comes super handy when I'm grilling in
the winter time.

27
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,270
Another one is a good grill rake or tongs.

28
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,950
That allows you to move the coals around and
get them in just the perfect position.

29
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,389
But of course, you are going to need some
charcoal and they come in two main categories.

30
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:31,539
The first one is lump and it is generally
more expensive and it is made out of whole

31
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:32,539
wood.

32
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:34,859
The benefit is you get better flavor and a
lot less ash.

33
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:38,219
The second one is charcoal briquettes which
are made out of compressed sawdust and some

34
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:39,219
binders.

35
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:42,459
Generally speaking, this is what I recommend
for beginners because it gives you more even

36
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:44,560
heat and is a lot easier to find.

37
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,939
Its biggest drawback though is that it can
produce a bit more white smoke when you first

38
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,579
light it up, but if you wait just a little
bit longer before you put it on the grill,

39
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:54,749
you'll be able to get through that and have
great consistent results.

40
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:58,159
You can make great grilled food with either
one, but I do recommend that you stay away

41
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,669
from match light charcoal or anything that
has lighter fluid in it.

42
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:05,329
Lighter fluid can add a chemical taste to
your food and I avoid it at all costs.

43
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:09,560
A common mistake is they don't leave enough
time to light the charcoal before they need

44
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,610
to start cooking.

45
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,620
Plan on around 30 minutes before you are ready
to go.

46
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,200
Lighting your charcoal in a chimney is easy.

47
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,849
Grab a few sheets of newspaper and put a couple
drops of oil on them to help them a bit burn

48
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:20,849
longer.

49
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,269
Crumple them up and put them on the bottom
of the chimney.

50
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:24,760
Fill the chimney with charcoal.

51
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,110
3/4s full is a good place to start for most
general grilling.

52
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,150
Remember the more charcoal you light, the
hotter your fire will be.

53
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,700
While it is lit, you are going to watch the
smoke go from white, to grey, to clear and

54
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,939
that is when you are going to know that it
is ready to go.

55
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:41,730
Another common mistake is to pull your charcoal
too early before it is fully lit and if you

56
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,019
do that you are going to be fighting the temperatures,
trying to raise them for a really long tine.

57
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:49,150
It is a lot better to spend an extra couple
of minutes in the chimney to make sure those

58
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,799
coals are fully lit.

59
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:53,270
How you place your coals depends on the type
of cooking you are doing.

60
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:57,060
A thick layer is good for searing steaks or
a thinner layer is good for direct grilling

61
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,530
burgers and chicken.

62
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,080
I intentionally left half the grill without
charcoal to give me a spot to retreat to if

63
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,269
things get too hot.

64
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:06,659
That gives me lots of options during the cook
when dinner is on the line.

65
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:10,269
Now is a good time to add some wood chunks
or chips if you want a bit more flavor.

66
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:13,280
Just Take it easy . . . a little bit goes
a long way.

67
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,819
After I put the charcoal on, I like to ease
into my target temperature by leaving the

68
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:21,250
vents fully open until I reach about50 degrees
Farenheit below my target temp.

69
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,810
Then I'll start dialing it back a little bit
so that way it slowly ramps up.

70
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,829
Because if you overshoot, It is a lot harder
to reduce the temperatures later.

71
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:32,599
Your vent settings depend on a lot of factors
including wind, the weather, the temperature,

72
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:35,969
and the kind of charcoal that you are using,
so these are just general guidelines to help

73
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:36,969
you on your path.

74
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:40,870
For long cooks that are low and slow, like
ribs leave the bottom and top vent a quarter

75
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,870
open.

76
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,390
For common roasting temperatures, half open
on the bottom and almost fully open on top

77
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,079
is a good starting point.

78
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:51,400
For searing or high temperature roasting,
leave the top and bottom vents completely

79
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
open.

80
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,689
The vents control the temperature of the kettle
by allowing more or less oxygen to feed the

81
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:56,689
fire.

82
00:03:56,689 --> 00:04:00,299
If you close the vents entirely, both top
and bottom, you'll snuff it out and save the

83
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:01,299
charcoal for next time.

84
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:06,680
If you are used to using a gas grill, adjusting
the temperature will not be as simple as turning

85
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,680
the knob.

86
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,349
You need to wait 10 or 15 minutes in between
adjustments Just to let the fire equalize

87
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:13,629
a bit before you think about making another
one.

88
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,332
If you don't wait, you are going to have to
make a ton of adjustments and you are going

89
00:04:16,332 --> 00:04:18,970
to be chasing and fighting those temperatures
all day long.

90
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,510
Mastering your charcoal lighting is a really
important skill and I have a deep dive on

91
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,480
