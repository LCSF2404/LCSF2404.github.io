            <li class="faq-question">What types of BBQ grills do you offer?</li>
            <p>We offer a variety of BBQ grills to suit different preferences and cooking styles. Our selection includes gas grills for those who appreciate convenience and precision, charcoal grills for those who enjoy the authentic smoky flavor, and pellet grills that combine the best features of both gas and charcoal grilling. Additionally, we offer electric grills for indoor use or for people with limited space.</p>
            
            <li class="faq-question">How do I choose the right BBQ grill for me?</li>
            <p>Choosing the right BBQ grill depends on your cooking style, available space, and fuel preferences. If you love the smoky flavor and enjoy the process of grilling, a charcoal grill might be the right choice for you. On the other hand, if you prefer convenience and precise temperature control, a gas grill could be the better option. Pellet grills offer the best of both worlds, delivering excellent flavor and versatility, while electric grills are perfect for small spaces or indoor use.</p>
            
            <li class="faq-question">Can I use my BBQ grill indoors?</li>
            <p>Most BBQ grills are designed for outdoor use only, as grilling indoors can pose serious safety risks, including carbon monoxide poisoning and fire hazards. However, electric grills are an exception. These grills are safe for indoor use and provide a convenient, smoke-free way to enjoy grilling indoors.</p>
            
            <li class="faq-question">How do I prevent flare-ups on my BBQ grill?</li>
            <p>Flare-ups occur when fat drips onto the heat source, causing flames to rise. To prevent flare-ups, trim excess fat from your meats before grilling. It's also helpful to use a two-zone cooking system, where one side of the grill is set to high heat and the other side to low, allowing you to move food away from the flames if necessary. Cleaning your grill regularly to remove grease buildup and using a drip tray will also help reduce the risk of flare-ups.</p>
            
            <li class="faq-question">What is the difference between a BBQ grill and a smoker?</li>
            <p>A BBQ grill and a smoker serve different purposes. A grill is typically used for high-heat, direct cooking, which allows you to sear meat quickly and cook it at a higher temperature. Smokers, on the other hand, are used for low and slow cooking, where food is cooked at a low temperature over a longer period of time. This slow cooking method allows the meat to absorb the smoky flavors and results in tender, juicy dishes like brisket or pulled pork.</p>
            
            <li class="faq-question">Can I store my BBQ grill outside in winter?</li>
            <p>It is possible to store your BBQ grill outside during the winter, but it’s important to take proper precautions to protect it. Make sure to cover your grill to shield it from snow, rain, and dirt. If you have a propane tank, it should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Before storing your grill for the winter, clean it thoroughly and grease the grates to prevent rusting.</p>
            
            <li class="faq-question">How do I know if my BBQ grill is cooking evenly?</li>
            <p>To ensure your BBQ grill is cooking evenly, preheat the grill properly before placing your food on it. You can also check the grill's temperature with a grill thermometer to make sure it’s consistent across the surface. Rotating your food occasionally during cooking will also help achieve more even heat distribution. If you notice that some areas of your grill are too hot or too cool, you can adjust the temperature or move the food around to avoid overcooking or undercooking.</p>
            
            <li class="faq-question">Can I get replacement parts for my BBQ grill?</li>
            <p>Yes, we offer a wide range of replacement parts for most BBQ grill models, including burners, grates, ignition systems, and more. You can browse our selection of parts on our website or contact our customer support team for help in finding the right replacement part for your grill.</p>
            
            <li class="faq-question">Do you offer BBQ grill assembly services?</li>
            <p>We do offer assembly services for certain BBQ grills. To check if assembly is available for the model you're interested in, please visit the product page or reach out to our customer service team for more information. If you prefer to assemble the grill yourself, we provide detailed instructions and videos to guide you through the process.</p>
